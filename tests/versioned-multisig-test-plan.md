# Versioned Multisig Test Plan

## 1. Creation Tests

### Basic Creation
```typescript
it("Creates a versioned multisig with basic configuration")
it("Creates a versioned multisig with maximum members")
it("Creates a versioned multisig with minimum threshold")
it("Creates a versioned multisig with maximum threshold")
```

### Creation Edge Cases
```typescript
it("Fails to create with empty members")
it("Fails to create with duplicate members")
it("Fails to create with threshold > member count")
it("Fails to create with invalid permissions")
```

## 2. Member Management Tests

### Adding Members
```typescript
it("Adds a new member with basic permissions")
it("Adds multiple members in sequence")
it("Adds a member with all permissions")
it("Verifies new member can only vote on new proposals")
it("Verifies member join_proposal_index is set correctly")
```

### Adding Member Edge Cases
```typescript
it("Fails to add duplicate member")
it("Fails to add member when at max capacity")
it("Handles adding member who was previously removed")
it("Verifies member cannot vote on proposals before join_proposal_index")
```

### Removing Members
```typescript
it("Removes a member with no active votes")
it("Removes a member with existing approved votes")
it("Removes a member with existing rejected votes")
it("Removes multiple members in sequence")
```

### Removing Member Edge Cases
```typescript
it("Fails to remove last member")
it("Fails to remove non-existent member")
it("Verifies removed member cannot vote on new proposals")
it("Verifies existing votes remain after member removal")
```

## 3. Proposal Creation Tests

### Basic Proposal Creation
```typescript
it("Creates proposal with all original members eligible")
it("Creates proposal with subset of members eligible")
it("Creates proposal immediately after adding member")
it("Creates multiple proposals in sequence")
```

### Proposal Creation Edge Cases
```typescript
it("Creates proposal with minimum eligible voters")
it("Handles proposal creation after member removal")
it("Verifies proposal index increments correctly")
it("Verifies eligible voters list is accurate")
```

## 4. Voting Tests

### Basic Voting
```typescript
it("Allows eligible member to approve")
it("Allows eligible member to reject")
it("Tracks vote counts correctly")
it("Executes proposal when threshold met")
```

### Vote Eligibility
```typescript
it("Prevents new member voting on old proposals")
it("Allows new member voting on new proposals")
it("Maintains old member votes after removal")
it("Verifies threshold calculation per proposal")
```

### Vote Edge Cases
```typescript
it("Handles all members voting")
it("Handles minimum threshold votes")
it("Prevents double voting")
it("Handles vote changes")
```

## 5. Threshold Tests

### Threshold Calculations
```typescript
it("Calculates correct threshold for original members")
it("Adjusts threshold when members added")
it("Maintains threshold when members removed")
it("Handles minimum threshold cases")
```

### Threshold Edge Cases
```typescript
it("Handles threshold with one eligible voter")
it("Verifies threshold with maximum members")
it("Calculates threshold correctly after multiple member changes")
it("Maintains proposal-specific thresholds")
```

## 6. Concurrent Operation Tests

### Parallel Operations
```typescript
it("Handles multiple proposals simultaneously")
it("Processes votes on different proposals concurrently")
it("Manages member changes during active proposals")
it("Maintains proposal independence")
```

### Race Conditions
```typescript
it("Handles rapid proposal creation")
it("Manages concurrent vote submissions")
it("Processes member changes during voting")
it("Maintains state consistency under load")
```

## 7. State Consistency Tests

### Member State
```typescript
it("Maintains correct member count")
it("Preserves member permissions")
it("Tracks join indices accurately")
it("Handles member list sorting")
```

### Proposal State
```typescript
it("Maintains proposal indices")
it("Preserves vote records")
it("Tracks eligible voters")
it("Updates proposal status correctly")
```

## 8. Permission Tests

### Basic Permissions
```typescript
it("Enforces initiate permission for proposal creation")
it("Enforces vote permission for voting")
it("Enforces execute permission for execution")
it("Handles permission combinations")
```

### Permission Edge Cases
```typescript
it("Handles permission changes")
it("Verifies permission inheritance")
it("Manages permission conflicts")
it("Validates permission requirements")
```

## 9. Transaction Tests

### Transaction Processing
```typescript
it("Processes single instruction transaction")
it("Handles multi-instruction transaction")
it("Executes time-locked transaction")
it("Manages transaction failure")
```

### Transaction Edge Cases
```typescript
it("Handles transaction size limits")
it("Manages account validation")
it("Processes complex transactions")
it("Handles failed execution")
```

## 10. Integration Tests

### System Integration
```typescript
it("Integrates with external programs")
it("Handles CPI calls")
it("Manages program upgrades")
it("Processes cross-program invocations")
```

### State Management
```typescript
it("Maintains state across multiple transactions")
it("Handles account resizing")
it("Manages rent exemption")
it("Processes account closure")
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Growth Pattern
```typescript
describe("Multisig Growth", () => {
    it("1. Creates basic multisig")
    it("2. Adds members over time")
    it("3. Creates proposals at each stage")
    it("4. Verifies voting power changes")
})
```

### Scenario 2: Member Churn
```typescript
describe("Member Turnover", () => {
    it("1. Starts with full member set")
    it("2. Gradually replaces members")
    it("3. Verifies proposal handling")
    it("4. Validates vote counting")
})
```

### Scenario 3: High Activity
```typescript
describe("High Activity Period", () => {
    it("1. Creates multiple proposals")
    it("2. Processes concurrent votes")
    it("3. Handles member changes")
    it("4. Manages execution queue")
})
```

## Error Cases to Test

1. **Account Validation**
   - Invalid account ownership
   - Incorrect account sizes
   - Missing required accounts

2. **Permission Violations**
   - Unauthorized proposal creation
   - Invalid vote attempts
   - Unauthorized execution

3. **State Transitions**
   - Invalid proposal status changes
   - Incorrect vote counting
   - Improper threshold calculations

4. **Resource Limits**
   - Maximum member count
   - Account size limitations
   - Instruction size constraints

## Test Environment Setup

```typescript
describe("Versioned Multisig Tests", () => {
    let provider: anchor.Provider;
    let program: anchor.Program;
    let multisig: PublicKey;
    
    before(async () => {
        // Setup test environment
    });

    // Test suites
});
```
