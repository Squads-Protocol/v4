# Time-Window Multisig Documentation

## Overview
A multisig implementation that uses time windows for membership changes to avoid the complexities of dynamic thresholds. This approach provides clear boundaries between membership changes and active proposals while maintaining security.

## Core Features
- Dedicated time windows for membership changes
- Clear separation between member management and proposal creation
- Automatic vote handling for departing members
- Predictable threshold calculations

## Implementation Details

### 1. Time Window System
```rust
pub struct TimeWindowMultisig {
    // Time window configuration
    pub membership_window_duration: i64,  // How long the window stays open
    pub last_membership_window: i64,      // When the last window closed
    pub is_window_open: bool,             // Current window status
    
    // Standard multisig fields
    pub members: Vec<Member>,
    pub threshold: u16,
    pub proposals: Vec<Pubkey>,
}
```

### 2. Window Management
```rust
impl TimeWindowMultisig {
    pub fn open_membership_window(&mut self, current_time: i64) -> Result<()> {
        require!(!self.is_window_open, MultisigError::WindowAlreadyOpen);
        require!(
            self.active_proposals.is_empty(),
            MultisigError::ActiveProposalsExist
        );
        
        self.is_window_open = true;
        self.last_membership_window = current_time;
        Ok(())
    }

    pub fn close_membership_window(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        require!(self.is_window_open, MultisigError::WindowNotOpen);
        self.is_window_open = false;
        self.recalculate_threshold()?;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Membership Changes
- Only allowed during open windows
- No active proposals can exist during window
- Clear threshold calculation at window close

### 2. Vote Management
```rust
pub fn handle_member_departure(&mut self, leaving_member: Pubkey) -> Result<()> {
    // Find all active proposals
    for proposal in self.active_proposals.iter_mut() {
        match proposal.get_vote(leaving_member) {
            Some(Vote::Approved) | Some(Vote::Rejected) => {
                // Keep explicit votes
                continue;
            }
            _ => {
                // Mark as rejected if no explicit vote
                proposal.add_vote(leaving_member, Vote::Rejected)?;
            }
        }
    }
    self.remove_member(leaving_member)
}
```

### 3. Proposal Management
```rust
pub fn create_proposal(&self) -> Result<()> {
    require!(
        !self.is_window_open,
        MultisigError::MembershipWindowOpen
    );
    // Normal proposal creation logic
}
```

## Advantages

1. **Predictability**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - No mid-proposal membership changes
   - Predictable threshold calculations

2. **Simplicity**
   - Simpler implementation than dynamic threshold
   - Fewer edge cases to handle
   - Clearer user experience

3. **Security**
   - No vote dilution issues
   - Clear handling of departing members
   - Predictable voting power

## State Transitions

```
                  Window Opens
[Normal Operation] ----------> [Membership Changes]
        ^                            |
        |                           |
        ----------------------------|
              Window Closes
```

## Error Cases

```rust
pub enum MultisigError {
    WindowAlreadyOpen,
    WindowNotOpen,
    ActiveProposalsExist,
    MembershipWindowOpen,
    // ... other errors
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Window Duration**
   - Set appropriate window duration
   - Consider time zones and member availability
   - Allow emergency window opens with higher threshold

2. **Member Management**
   - Clear communication about window timing
   - Batch member changes when possible
   - Maintain minimum member requirements

3. **Proposal Timing**
   - Clear documentation of proposal lifecycle
   - Consider proposal urgency vs window timing
   - Emergency proposal mechanisms

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Window Timing
```rust
pub struct WindowConfig {
    pub min_duration: i64,      // Minimum window duration
    pub max_duration: i64,      // Maximum window duration
    pub cooldown_period: i64,   // Time between windows
}
```

### 2. Emergency Procedures
```rust
pub fn emergency_window_open(&mut self, current_time: i64) -> Result<()> {
    require!(
        self.can_emergency_override()?,
        MultisigError::InsufficientEmergencyVotes
    );
    self.open_membership_window(current_time)
}
```

### 3. Safety Checks
```rust
impl TimeWindowMultisig {
    pub fn validate_state(&self) -> Result<()> {
        require!(self.members.len() >= self.min_members, MultisigError::TooFewMembers);
        require!(self.threshold <= self.members.len(), MultisigError::InvalidThreshold);
        // Additional checks...
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Limitations

1. **Flexibility**
   - Fixed windows for membership changes
   - Potential delays for urgent member changes
   - Need for emergency procedures

2. **Coordination**
   - Requires member coordination for changes
   - Window timing may not suit all members
   - Potential for missed windows

3. **Emergency Handling**
   - Need for special emergency procedures
   - Balance between security and urgency
   - Clear criteria for emergencies

## Future Improvements

1. **Scheduling**
   - Automated window scheduling
   - Calendar integration
   - Timezone handling

2. **Communication**
   - Automated notifications
   - Window status tracking
   - Member coordination tools

3. **Analytics**
   - Window usage patterns
   - Member activity tracking
   - Optimization opportunities

## Conclusion
The time-window approach provides a more predictable and manageable solution to multisig membership changes while maintaining security and usability. It trades some flexibility for clarity and reduced complexity.
